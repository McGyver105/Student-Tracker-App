Student tracker app

This is a project that I've been undertaking alongside Keiran Cookson from the Northcoders Bootcamp.

The frontend section of this app interacts with a backend hosted on heroku and allows users to see a mock student tracker allowing people to access data on trainees enrolled on a course.

Hopefully in the coming weeks I'll be able to get this hosted live allowing users to interact with the site. The design of the page itself is still a work in progress as we've mainly been focusing on the functionality before making it look pretty. Once we've got all the features included, time will be spent created a responsive css that is accessible on both desktop and mobile screens.
