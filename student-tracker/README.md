Student tracker app

This is a project that I've been undertaking alongside Keiran Cookson from the Northcoders Bootcamp.

The frontend section of this app interacts with a backend hosted on heroku and allows users to see a mock student tracker allowing people to access data on trainees enrolled on a course.

Feel free to add and delete names as you want. The design of the page is still a work in progress as we've mainly been focusing on the functionality before making it look pretty.
